NORMALIZATION PROBLEM:

This code creates a 5x5 array X filled with random numbers between 0 and 1 using np.random.rand(). It then calculates the mean and standard deviation of the array and uses these values to normalize the data by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation. The normalized array X_normalized is printed and saved to a file named X_normalized.npy using np.save().


DIVISIBLE BY 3 PROBLEM:

This code creates an array X with integers from 1 to 100, squares each number, and reshapes the result into a 10x10 array. It then uses the modulo operation % to find elements in the reshaped array that are divisible by 3 and stores them in div_by_3. The divisible elements are printed, and the result is saved in a file named div_by_3.npy using np.save().
